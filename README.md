# Introduction to NAICS
### (North American Industry Classification System)
<hr>

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is an industry classification system developed by the
statistical agencies of Canada, Mexico and the United States. Created against the background of the North
American Free Trade Agreement, it is designed to provide common definitions of the industrial structure of the three
countries and a common statistical framework to facilitate the analysis of the three economies. NAICS is based on
supply-side or production-oriented principles, to ensure that industrial data, classified to NAICS, are suitable for the
analysis of production-related issues such as industrial performance.

Economic statistics describe the behaviour and activities of economic transactors and of the transactions that take
place among them. The economic transactors for which NAICS is designed are businesses and other organizations
engaged in the production of goods and services. They include farms, incorporated and unincorporated businesses
and government business enterprises. They also include government institutions and agencies engaged in the
production of marketed and non-marketed services, as well as organizations such as professional associations and
unions and charitable or non-profit organizations and the employees of households.
NAICS is a comprehensive system encompassing all economic activities. It has a hierarchical structure. At the
highest level, it divides the economy into 20 sectors. At lower levels, it further distinguishes the different economic
activities in which businesses are engaged
